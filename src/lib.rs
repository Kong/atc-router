/*!
This crate provides a powerful rule based matching engine that can match a set of routes
against dynamic input value efficiently.
It is mainly used inside the [Kong Gateway](https://github.com/Kong/kong)
for performing route matching against incoming requests and is used as a FFI binding
for LuaJIT.

Please see the [repositoty README.md](https://github.com/Kong/atc-router/blob/main/README.md)
for more detailed explainations of the concepts and APIs.

# Crate features

  Builds the FFI based interface which is suitable for use by a foreign language such as

* **serde** -
